IMPORTANT:
* go into musicInterface/views.py and update the location of thirst. I included the thirst folder but I couldn't import it relatively, so you will have to change it in order for messaging to work
* after that go back to the root folder, and run in terminal:

   python manage.py runserver 

* next open web broswer, and go to http://localhost:8000/m158/

*Lastly, going back to the root folder open this maxPatch:
  OPEN_ME_FOR_MAX/OPEN_ME.maxpat

*make sure you increase the volume!

*TADA!

------side note: I only have the notes working. Anything else entered will be ignored!----- 


*hope this runs smoothly!
